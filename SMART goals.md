## SMART goals
> SMART goals are a widely recognized strategy for setting objectives that are clear and reachable. The acronym SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Each component of the SMART framework works together to create goals that are carefully planned, clear, and trackable. Here’s how each element contributes to effective goal setting:

### Specific
Goals should be clear and specific to provide enough direction to guide you in what you want to accomplish. A specific goal answers the questions of:

What do I want to accomplish?
Why is this goal important?
Who is involved?
Where is it located?
Which resources or limits are involved?
For example, instead of saying "I want to get in shape," a specific goal would be, "I want to run a 5K in three months."

### Measurable
A goal should have criteria for measuring progress. This makes it easier to track your progress and know when you’ve achieved your goal. Ask yourself:

How much?
How many?
How will I know when it is accomplished?
Continuing with the earlier example, a measurable addition could be, "I will follow a training schedule to run three times a week to prepare for the 5K."

### Achievable
Your goal also needs to be realistic and attainable to be successful. It should stretch your abilities but still remain possible. When you set an achievable goal, you may have to ask:

How can I accomplish this goal?
How realistic is the goal, based on other constraints, such as financial factors?
For instance, if you’ve never run before, running a full marathon in three months might be unrealistic, but a 5K might be a challenging yet achievable goal.

### Relevant
This step ensures that your goal matters to you and that it also aligns with other relevant goals. We all need support and assistance in achieving our goals, but it’s important to retain control over them. So, make sure that your plans drive everyone forward, but that you're still responsible for achieving your own goal. Ask yourself:

Does this seem worthwhile?
Is this the right time?
Does this match our other efforts/needs?
For example, training for a 5K race might be relevant if your broader goal is to improve cardiovascular health.

### Time-bound
Every goal needs a target date, so that you have a deadline to focus on and something to work toward. This part of the SMART goal criteria helps to prevent everyday tasks from taking priority over your longer-term goals. A question to ask:

When can I achieve this goal?
In the 5K example, you might set the race date as your specific time-bound deadline.

### Example of a SMART Goal
"I want to run a 5K in three months, and I will prepare by following a training schedule to run three times a week, aiming to improve my endurance and speed gradually. This will help me improve my cardiovascular health and achieve my fitness goals."

> By applying the SMART criteria, you can create goals that are easier to manage and feel more tangible, making it more likely that you will achieve them.
